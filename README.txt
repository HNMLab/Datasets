Abstract: In the fast transient somatosensory processing, the ensemble of the first spikes in the spike trains encodes the dynamic tactile information. Here, inspired by the functional effectiveness of the spikes, we propose an artificial dynamic sensory system based on a new concept, position-encoded spike spectrum (PESS). We use a mixed ion-electron conductor (MIEC) to generate a potential spike signal. We design artificial receptors having different ion relaxation times (ÔÅ¥), thus a sequence of the spikes from the receptors creates a spike spectrum providing the spatial information (position, motion trace) and the temporal information (speed, dynamic contact area). With computational decoding of the PESS, the artificial sensory system can recognize complicated dynamic motions in real-time. The structural simplicity of the device allows a high-resolution spatiotemporal tactile perception and the use of ion enables the fabrication of flexible artificial skins.
